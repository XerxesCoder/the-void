# 🌌 The Void Protocol

> _“You are not singular. You are a convergence.”_

**The Void Protocol** is a cinematic, cosmic, and interactive web experience that guides users through the outer reaches of perception, consciousness, and intelligence. Choose your galaxy. Interact with ENTITY. Abandon your past. Embrace the unknown.

- 🪐 **React + Next.js App Router**
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS for cosmic aesthetics**
